Wash Your Hands For 20 Seconds - Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or touching surfaces. This simple habit removes germs and helps prevent the spread of infections.
Cover Nose And Mouth While Sneezing - Always cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or your elbow when you sneeze or cough. Dispose of used tissues immediately and wash your hands to prevent spreading germs to others around you.
Wear A Mask If Available - Wear a protective face mask whenever you are in public places or crowded areas. Masks help block droplets that may contain viruses, reducing your chances of inhaling or spreading infection.
Maintain Social Distance - Keep at least six feet distance from others, especially in crowded or enclosed spaces. Maintaining social distance helps prevent respiratory droplets from spreading and keeps you and others protected from viruses.
Stay Home If Unwell - If you feel unwell, have a fever, cough, or sore throat, stay at home and rest. Avoid going out until you recover completely to stop spreading infection to others in the community.
Get Vaccinated - Vaccination is one of the best ways to protect yourself and others from serious illness. Get your COVID-19 vaccines and boosters on time to build strong immunity and help reduce the spread of the virus.
Use Hand Sanitizer - When soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Gently rub your hands until dry to kill most germs and viruses effectively.
Avoid Touching Face - Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, as these are the main entry points for viruses. Keep your hands clean to reduce the chance of infection entering your body.
Clean And Disinfect Surfaces - Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces like doorknobs, phones, tables, and light switches. This prevents viruses and bacteria from lingering on objects you touch throughout the day.
