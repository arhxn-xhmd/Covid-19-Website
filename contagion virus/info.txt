Air Transmission - The coronavirus can spread through tiny droplets suspended in the air when an infected person breathes, talks, or sneezes. These airborne particles can infect others nearby even without direct contact.
Human Contact - Direct contact like handshakes or hugs can easily transmit the virus from one person to another. The virus can stay on hands and transfer to the mouth, nose, or eyes.
Contaminated Objects - The virus can survive on surfaces such as doorknobs, phones, or tables for hours. Touching these objects and then your face can cause infection.
Sneezing or Coughing Droplets - When an infected person sneezes or coughs, droplets carrying the virus spread in the air. Anyone nearby can inhale these droplets and get infected.
Touching Infected Surfaces - Frequently touched items like switches, railings, and buttons can hold the virus. Always sanitize or wash hands after touching public surfaces.
Close Contact in Crowded Places - Being close to many people increases the risk of transmission through droplets or air. Crowded spaces make it easier for the virus to spread quickly.
Talking Without Masks - Speaking without a mask allows droplets to travel through the air. Masks help block these droplets and reduce the risk of spreading the virus.
Poor Ventilation in Closed Spaces - Enclosed areas with little airflow let virus particles build up. Fresh air or open windows help reduce the spread.
Touching Face After Exposure - The virus can enter your body when you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth after contact with contaminated surfaces. Avoid touching your face and wash hands regularly.
